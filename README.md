# Recommendations with IBM

## Introduction

For this project, you will analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles you think they will like. The goal is to build a recommendation engine that helps users discover content that is relevant and interesting to them. Below, you can see an example of what the dashboard could look like displaying articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform.

## Project Overview

In this project, you will:
- Explore the dataset and understand the interactions between users and articles.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights.
- Implement different recommendation algorithms such as:
  - Rank-based recommendations
  - User-user collaborative filtering
  - Content-based recommendations
  - Matrix factorization

## Data

The dataset contains information about user interactions with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform. The key components of the dataset include:
- **User information**: Anonymized user IDs.
- **Article information**: Article IDs and metadata.
- **Interaction information**: Logs of user interactions with articles, such as views, likes, and comments.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the data by running the `data_preprocessing.py` script.
   ```bash
   python src/data_preprocessing.py
   ```

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understand the dataset by running the `exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb` notebook.

3. **Recommendation Algorithms**: Implement and test different recommendation algorithms by running the corresponding notebooks:
   - Rank-Based Recommendations: `rank_based_recommendations.ipynb`
   - User-User Collaborative Filtering: `user_user_collaborative_filtering.ipynb`
   - Content-Based Recommendations: `content_based_recommendations.ipynb`
   - Matrix Factorization: `matrix_factorization.ipynb`

4. **Generate Recommendations**: Use the implemented algorithms to generate recommendations for users.
